# A personal website, built with Astro

I'm not a Web Developer, but it feels like everyone has a personal website nowadays. In the pursuit of a website for myself, I created this repository. It houses my experimentations with [Astro](https://astro.build/). It reached a point where I thought it was worth sharing.

## Repository Status

This repository is now **read-only**. The living version of the code has been moved to [gselzer.github.io](https://github.com/gselzer/gselzer.github.io). Any future updates or changes will be made there.

## License

Anyone is free to use this code for themselves. Feel free to fork, modify, or adapt it to your needs.
